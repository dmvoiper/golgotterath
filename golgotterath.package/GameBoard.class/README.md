GameBoard is the main Morph that to an extent 'is' the game. It creates or loads the map

How to read in and convert sprite sheets;

"Make and encode the original image file bytes"
|img writeStream encoded byteArray newImg method|
img := PNGReadWriter formFromStream: 'imagefile.png' asFileReference binaryReadStream.
writeStream := WriteStream on: ByteArray new.
PNGReadWriter putForm: img onStream: writeStream.
encoded := writeStream contents base64Encoded.

"Decode the base64Encoded bytes and display the image"
byteArray := encoded base64Decoded.
newImg := PNGReadWriter formFromStream: byteArray readStream.
newImg asMorph openInHand.

method := (String streamContents: [:s |
    s
        nextPutAll: 'getEncoded';
        nextPut: Character cr;
        nextPut: Character tab;
        nextPut: $';
        nextPutAll: encoded;
        nextPut: $']).
"Add the method to the Sprite subclass"

Note!  The getEncoded method created does not have the return charatcer, so you need to edit the method and formally return the value using ^
