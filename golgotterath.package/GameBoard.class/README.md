"Make and encode the original image file bytes"
img := PNGReadWriter formFromStream: imageFile binaryReadStream.
writeStream := WriteStream on: ByteArray new.
PNGReadWriter putForm: img onStream: writeStream.
encoded := writeStream contents base64Encoded.

"Decode the base64Encoded bytes and display the image"
byteArray := encoded base64Decoded.
newImg := PNGReadWriter formFromStream: byteArray readStream.
newImg asMorph openInHand.

method := (String streamContents: [:s |
    s
        nextPutAll: 'getEncoded';
        nextPut: Character cr;
        nextPut: Character tab;
        nextPut: $';
        nextPutAll: encoded;
        nextPut: $']).
